# Deno VM
Deno version of the vm to low level javascript using typescript :D

## Reflections
Typescript is very easy to use when you know a bit of JavaScript. Implementing in ts has mostly been 
putting types where needed and using export/import instead of module.exports/require.

Probably more I could do, might be smart to add more types where it makes sense.

## How to run
`deno run index.ts`
