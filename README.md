# 16 bit vm
This is a project where i follow the [16 bit VM series by Low Level Javascript on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP29wDx6QmW5DdwpdwHCRJsEubS5NrQ9b).

It is an excellent series which will be fun to implement. To practice both 
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
I'm going to try to implement the vm in those languages as well, using [Deno](https://deno.land/) for the TypeScript one.
