# 16 bit vm
This is a project where i follow the [16 bit VM series by Low Level Javascript on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP29wDx6QmW5DdwpdwHCRJsEubS5NrQ9b).

It is an excellent series which will be fun to implement. To practice both rust and TypeScript I'm going
to try to implement the vm in those languages as well, using deno for the TypeScript one.
